# ðŸš¢ Exploring the Titanic Dataset: A Comprehensive EDA Project ðŸ§©
I am excited to share my latest project where I performed a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. This project showcases my ability to manipulate data, create a robust pipeline, and visualize insights using industry-standard tools. Here's a breakdown of the steps I followed:

# **Data Loading and Manipulation:**

**Loaded the Titanic dataset from Seaborn.**

Utilized Pandas for comprehensive data manipulation tasks, including dropping unnecessary columns, replacing missing values, and changing data types to ensure consistency.

# **Database Integration:**

Connected to SQL using SQLAlchemy, highlighting my skills in database management.
Created a database named Titanic and a table named CLEAN to store the processed data.
Dumped the cleaned data into SQL, demonstrating seamless integration between Python and SQL.
Target Table Creation:

Designed and created a target table in SQL, preparing the data for detailed analysis and reporting.

# **Data Visualization and Reporting:**

**Imported the processed data into Power BI.**
Created insightful visualizations and generated a comprehensive report to uncover patterns and trends in the dataset.

# **Pipeline Design:**

Designed the entire data processing and analysis pipeline, ensuring a smooth flow from data loading to report generation.

This project not only highlights my technical skills in data manipulation, SQL, and Power BI but also my ability to design and implement end-to-end data analysis pipelines. I look forward to applying these skills to more complex datasets and uncovering deeper insights.
